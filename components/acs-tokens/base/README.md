Uses a post-sync hook to generate ACS tokens for various namespaces to consume. Useful when there is a need to integrate with ACS for image scanning, etc.

Namespaces can be passed in a comma-separated list via environment variables.

based on Andrew Pitt's tekton task here: https://github.com/pittar-gitops/gitops-mono-repo-admins/tree/main/03-cluster-services/08-advanced-cluster-security/pipelines-and-secrets
